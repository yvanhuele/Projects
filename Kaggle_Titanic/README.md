## Kaggle Titanic 

This project documents my attempts at Kaggle's [*Titanic: Machine Learning through Disaster*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) Competition:

* [Part 1](./titanic1.md): I used the R libraries `trees` and `randomForest` to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.  The models were assessed using a simple validation set approach.
